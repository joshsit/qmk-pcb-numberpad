# qmk-pcb-numberpad
Project files for development of twelve key mechanical keyboard numberpad with custom PCB. 

2025-06-19, build v1:
- some of the switches were not seated fully (not flush to the pcb) when soldering, need to ensure fully seated for next iteration
- assembled keyboard looks a little funny without a top plate, need to figure out how to raise the rp2040 zero if wanting to add a top plate
- switches may come loose if just held on by soldering welds to the legs, might need to glue the support pins or add a top plate
